"""
#The script called: "mtu_find" is useful to retrieve all MTU values from Cisco devices.
#Currently most of the interfaces should be using JumboFrames(9200).

#Import Libraries:
    - re (Regular Expressions)
    - pandas (Split a dictionary in columns)
    - getpass (to request password dynamically)

# Notes
    If you are using Pycharm remember "Run > Edit Configurations > Execution > Run with Python Console".
    Otherwise getpass library is now working.
